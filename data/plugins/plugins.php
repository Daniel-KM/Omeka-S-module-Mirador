 * List of js plugins that can be dynamically added to Mirador viewer.
 *
 * It is used to have a multiple select field in the site settings page or in a
 * block page. It allows to include automatically the css and the js assets too.
 * The files themselves are included via `view/common/helper/mirador-plugins.phtml`.
 * The options should be set via the json textarea or via the theme.
 *
 * Note:
 * Currently, with Mirador 3, plugins should be included and compiled with the
 * bundle, so they are not available separately, but hidden.
