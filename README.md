Mirador Viewer (module for Omeka S)
===================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Mirador Viewer] is a module for [Omeka S] that integrates [Mirador], an
advanced online viewer for images, so it can display books, images, maps, etc.
via the [IIIF] standard. Common plugins are included.

[Mirador] is an open-source, web based, multi-window image viewing platform with
the ability to zoom, display, compare and annotate images from around the world.
It's configurable and fully extensible via plugins. The version 2.7 and 3.0 are
available.

It uses the resources of any [IIIF] compliant server. The full specification of
the "International Image Interoperability Framework" standard is supported
(level 2). If you don’t have an [IIPImage] server, Omeka S can be one! Just
install the module [IIIF Server].

It’s an alternative to the [Universal Viewer] or the lighter [Diva Viewer].


Installation
------------

First, install the two optional modules [Generic] and [Blocks Disposition].

The module uses an external js library [Mirador], so use the release zip to
install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [Mirador.zip] from the list of releases (the master
does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `Mirador`, and go to the root module, and run:

```sh
# Install mirador 2.7.0 in asset/vendor/mirador-2.
composer install --no-dev
# Install mirador 3.0 in asset/vendor/mirador.
npm install
gulp
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

If you don’t have an IIIF Server, install the module [IIIF Server].

If you need to display big images (bigger than 1 to 10 MB according to your
server and your network), use an external image server, or create tiles with [IIIF Server].
The tiling means that big images like maps and deep paintings, and any other
images, are converted into tiles in order to load and zoom them instantly.


Usage
-----

### Configuration

Only one option can be set in the main config (the manifest property, if any).

The other ones can be set differently for each site:

- in site settings via the plugin select. See [below](#plugins).
- in site settings via a json object, that will be merged with the default
  config of the viewer, and with the options set directly in theme, if any.
- via the theme of the site: copy file `view/common/helper/mirador.phtml` in
  your theme and customize it;
- via the theme of the site and the assets (`asset/vendor/mirador`).

#### Mirador 2.7

The parameters used to config the viewer can be found in the [wiki], in the
details of the [api] and in the examples of the [tutorial].

The following placeholders can be used (without quote or double quotes):
- `__manifestUri__`: first manifest uri (or collection uri),
- `__canvasID__`, first canvas uri of the manifest.

For example, this params can be set to display an item in [Zen mode]:

```json
{
    "mainMenuSettings": {
        "show": false
    },
    "windowObjects": [
        {
            "loadedManifest": __manifestUri__,
            "canvasID": __canvasID__,
            "viewType": "ImageView",
            "displayLayout": false,
            "bottomPanel": false,
            "sidePanel": false,
            "annotationLayer": false,
            "canvasControls": {
                "annotations": false,
                "imageManipulation": {
                    "manipulationLayer": false
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This config is for item, not for collection. This example is for the site
setting because it uses placeholders, so it should be adapted if used in theme
in order to take the default parameters in account. The keys `id` and `data` are
automatically filled, but may be overridden too.

#### Mirador 3.0

The parameters used to config the viewer can be found in in the [recipes] and in
the details of the file [settings.js].

### Display

If the [IIIF Server] is installed, all resources of Omeka S are automatically
available by Mirador.

The viewer is always available at `http://www.example.com/item-set/{item-set id}/mirador`
and `http://www.example.com/item/{item id}/mirador`. Furthermore, it is
automatically embedded in "item-set/{id}" and "item/{id}" show and/or browse
pages. This can be disabled via the module [Blocks Disposition] for each site.
Finally, a block layout is available to add the viewer in any standard page.

To embed Mirador somewhere else, just use the helper:

```php
    // Display the viewer with the specified item set.
    echo $this->mirador($itemSet);

    // Display the viewer with the specified item and specified options.
    // The options for Mirador are directly passed to the partial, so they are
    // available in the theme and set for the viewer.
    echo $this->mirador($item, $options);

    // Display multiple resources (items and/or item sets).
    echo $this->mirador($resources);
```


### Plugins

Plugins add small features to the Mirador viewer.

Some plugins require json options to work. Some plugins may not work with the
integrated version of Mirador. Cross compatibility and options has not been
checked, so add them one by one and only the needed ones.

List of images in fullscreen in Mirador 2
-----------------------------------------

This fix is needed only for Mirador 2.

The standard Mirador doesn’t allow to have the bottom sidebar (list of images)
in fullscreen, so it’s hard to browse. It’s not a bug, it’s a [feature].
To fix it without patching and recompilation, just run this replacement command
from the root of the module:

```sh
rpl 'toggleFullScreen:function(){OpenSeadragon.isFullScreen()?(this.element.find(".mirador-osd-fullscreen i").removeClass("fa-expand").addClass("fa-compress"),this.element.find(".mirador-osd-toggle-bottom-panel").hide(),this.eventEmitter.publish("SET_BOTTOM_PANEL_VISIBILITY."+this.id,!1)):(this.element.find(".mirador-osd-fullscreen i").removeClass("fa-compress").addClass("fa-expand"),this.element.find(".mirador-osd-toggle-bottom-panel").show(),this.eventEmitter.publish("SET_BOTTOM_PANEL_VISIBILITY."+this.id,!0))},' 'toggleFullScreen:function(){OpenSeadragon.isFullScreen()?(this.element.find(".mirador-osd-fullscreen i").removeClass("fa-expand").addClass("fa-compress")/*,this.element.find(".mirador-osd-toggle-bottom-panel").hide(),this.eventEmitter.publish("SET_BOTTOM_PANEL_VISIBILITY."+this.id,!1)*/):(this.element.find(".mirador-osd-fullscreen i").removeClass("fa-compress").addClass("fa-expand")/*,this.element.find(".mirador-osd-toggle-bottom-panel").show(),this.eventEmitter.publish("SET_BOTTOM_PANEL_VISIBILITY."+this.id,!0)*/)},' asset/vendor/mirador/mirador.min.js
```

If wanted, you can fix this feature in the Mirador 2.7.0 source file too:
comment lines 42779, 42780, 42783, and 42784.
