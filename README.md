Installation
------------
The module uses an external library [MiradorViewer], so use the release zip to
install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [`MiradorViewer.zip`] from the list of releases (the
master does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules`
directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `MiradorViewer`, and go to the root of the module, and run:

```
    composer install
```

The next times:

```
    composer update
```
